Terraria has an abundance of natural resources, but not many of them are reproducable. This project aims to change that and more.


**Main features, all of which are configurable:**
-A scavenge ability that allows Right-Clicking certain plants (such as grass, lily pads, cattails and sea oats) for resources.
-Craftable fruits.
-Renewable Stone, Silt, Sand, Dirt, Clay, and many other natural resources.
-Recipes for Fabric-based materials, such as Hay, Cobweb, Silk, and Leather.
-Vegetational Rejuvenation through Mushrooms, as they are an herb that potentially boosts plant growth.
-Recipes for basic tools, like the Sickle, Bug Net and Staff of Regrowth.
-Work Station recipes, such as the Extractinator, Tinkerer's Workshop and Ice Machine.


-v0.8.5.3-
-Changed the Scavenge mechanic from a Right-Click ability to a simple "Tile Break" function. (In other words, plants are to be destroyed rather than Right-Clicked.)
-Added configuration for Moss and Uncommon Plants, and adjusted the balancing accordingly.

-v0.8.5.4-
-Added the "Moss to Cobweb" recipe and the "Moss" Recipe Group.
-Added Water Bucket, Lava Bucket and Honey Bucket recipes.

-v0.8.5.5-
