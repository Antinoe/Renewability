Terraria has an abundance of natural resources, but not many of them are reproducable. This project aims to change that and more.


**Main features, all of which are configurable:**
-A scavenge ability that allows Right-Clicking certain plants (such as grass, lily pads, cattails and sea oats) for resources.
-Craftable fruits.
-Renewable Stone, Silt, Sand, Dirt, Clay, and many other natural resources.
-Recipes for Fabric-based materials, such as Hay, Cobweb, Silk, and Leather.
-Vegetational Rejuvenation through Mushrooms, as they are an herb that potentially boosts plant growth.
-Recipes for basic tools, like the Sickle, Bug Net and Staff of Regrowth.
-Work Station recipes, such as the Extractinator, Tinkerer's Workshop and Ice Machine.


-v0.8.5.3-
-Changed the Scavenge mechanic from a Right-Click ability to a simple "Tile Break" function. (In other words, plants are to be destroyed rather than Right-Clicked.)
-Added configuration for Moss and Uncommon Plants, and adjusted the balancing accordingly.

-v0.8.5.4-
-Added the "Moss to Cobweb" recipe and the "Moss" Recipe Group.
-Added Water Bucket, Lava Bucket and Honey Bucket recipes.

-v0.8.5.5-
-(For some reason, the mod didn't actually upload the update, so here I am, uploading it again. :moyai:) Updated the mod for the July 2022 update of tModLoader.
-Changed the Mod Title from "Renewability" to "Renewability (Earthen Quality of Life)".
-Changed the Mod Icon.

-v0.8.6-
-Added a config option to grant Hay, Cobweb and Moss value, that way they may be sold.
-Ropes are now craftable by hand, not at the Loom.
-Reworked the entire Config for Scavenging.
-Fixed the Moss recipe group. Red Moss has now been added.
-Changed Scavenging back to a Right-Click feature.
-Adjusted the values of the recipe changes.

-v0.8.6.1-
[-] There was an error with updating the mod 2 months ago, causing the game to think that an older version was the latest release. I am updating it again now to fix this issue.

-v0.8.6.2-
[=] Fixed the "Cobweb to Rope" recipe. It now results in 3 instead of 1.
[+] A Glove icon will now display over Tiles that are Scavengeable (only if Scavenging is enabled for them).
